# Social Network Analysis (SNA) in Introductory Statistics Classrooms Project

## Project Description
I lead a team of researchers to collect and analyze data on student's connections with one another in introductory statistics classes to see whether classroom connectedness within the lab section of statistics courses was associated with student's stress, anxiety, depression, grit, and/or resilience.
